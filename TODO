## Future

1. ~Given a timestamp, keep downloading until you hit it (using the async `chan-while`)~
2. ~(Store into files / read from files so we don't need to repeat 1)~
3. From S3, fetch the Datomic dev-local DB file
4. Store into Datomic local
5. Upload the updated file
6. Use Datomic to extract the info for generating the monthly summary pages
