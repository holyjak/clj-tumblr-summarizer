## Now

1. Look into using GH Actions for the build and GH Pages for the search site
2. Build Lunr search index - http://cryogenweb.org/docs/add-basic-search.html
3. Make a static search site with Lunr on GH Pages or S3
4. Add `latest.edn` so it is easier to see where to start downloading from w/o getting all the past files from storage
5. Datahike to enable the monthly summaries logic


----

## Future

1. ~Given a timestamp, keep downloading until you hit it (using the async `chan-while`)~
2. ~(Store into files / read from files so we don't need to repeat 1)~
3. From S3, fetch the Datomic dev-local DB file
4. Store into Datomic local
5. Upload the updated file
6. Use Datomic to extract the info for generating the monthly summary pages
